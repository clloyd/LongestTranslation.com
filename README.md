Hapi.js powered backend that uses jspm and react on the front end

##Getting Started

You'll need jspm to install dependancies (along with npm)
```
npm install jspm -g
```
And use npm and jspm to install dependancies.

```
npm install
```
```
jspm install
```
Once all dependancies are installed then you can call init.js with a YANDEX_KEY variable
```
YANDEX_KEY=your_yandex_api_key node init.js
